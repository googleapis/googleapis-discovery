## Google APIs

This repository contains the periodically updated snapshot of 
Google Discovery API definitions listed at https://www.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis. 
Only the whitelisted subset of the API definitions is stored. 

Each of the discovery documents is stored atomically together with its proto3 
representation generated by [disco-to-proto3-converter ](https://github.com/googleapis/disco-to-proto3-converter).


## Building
### Bazel

The recommended way to build the API client libraries is through
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) >= 3.0.0.

First, [install bazel](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/install.html).

To build all libraries:

```
bazel build //...
```

To test all libraries:

```
bazel test //...
```

To build one library in all languages:

```
bazel build //google/cloud/compute/v1/...
```

To build the Java package for one library:

```
bazel build //google/cloud/compute/v1:google-cloud-compute-v1-java
```
